PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
GhostDrive is a fully offline, uncensored AI companion designed to operate directly from a USB stick. It does not require an internet connection, cloud API keys, or server-based processing. All computation, memory, and interaction happen locallyâ€”ensuring maximum privacy, autonomy, and control.

The current version includes:
- A fine-tuned language model (GGUF format)
- A terminal-based interface
- Local memory logging and command execution
- Custom protocols like journaling and to-do management

This public version has been stripped of any proprietary training data and internal files. It is free to use, modify, and expand for personal or educational purposes.

- Community-sourced instructional content from **WikiHow**
- Custom prompts and philosophical frameworks authored by the project creator
